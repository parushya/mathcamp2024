This course will reintroduce students to basic topics in probability, linear algebra, and calculus through lectures, problem sets, and home work assignments. Students will also be exposed to the statistical software package R through a series of daily labs.\nYou can find the course syllabus and material from classes here.\nClasses would take place between 9 - 4 pm in ICC 234.\n\n\n\n\n\nSchedule for the Week",

    "text": "Why Code?\nA lot of diplomatic and fancy answers to it. But the key idea is that you want to be lazy about repetitive tasks (MBAs call it being “productive”).\nMany tasks - data cleaning, wrangling, visualization and statistical analysis - require you to do them many times. Moreover, you would want to be able to reproduce and replicate your thinking about all of the tasks mentioned above on many different datasets and sometime even on the same dataset after some time.\nCoding is about formalizing your thinking about how you are treating the data and automating the formalization task to be done repetitively. It improves efficiency, enhances reproducability, and boosts creativity when it comes to finding new patterns in your data.\nSix guidelines for data and statistical analyses:1",

Difference between Excel and coding\nReplicate-and-Reproduce: Ability to repeat the computational process which reflects your thinking and decisions that you took along the way. Improves transparency and forces one to be deliberate and responsible about choices during analyses.\n\nHuman Interpretability: Writing code is not just to analyse but allowing yourself and then others to be able to understand your analytic choices.\n\nPublic Good: Research is a public good. And the code allows your research to be truly accessible. This means you write a code that anyone else who understands the language can read, reuse, and recreate without you being present. We essentially ensure that by writing a readable and publicly readable code.",

    "text": "R and RStudio\nR is a free open source statistical programming language. We generally use R thorugh RStudio which is an integrated development environment (IDE). Essentially, it is the graphic user interface that allows us to use R in an efficient way. It has point-and-click functionality also (which we would not use a lot).\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio Screen\n\n\n\n\nR Scripts: This is where put your code in a script. The script is saved with a .R extension.\nConsole: Output from your code appears here. You can also write the code directly here. But it does not get saved. Also, by default it shows only a limited number or previous steps (commands + outputs). Not a good practice to code here.\nEnvironment: All the objects, datasets, lists, etc that you have created/loaded in the environment appear here. Alongside, you also see the custom functions that you might create.\nFile Browser/Help/Plot: Internal file navigators and help documentation for packages and functions appear here. Further, when you plot anything, that also get shown here.\nAn R script is a basic text file which you can read on text editors too. We use RStudio to run the code in a way that computer understands.\nComments: R inteprets every line in the script as a separate command. And it does for each line unless preceded by a #. Comments signal to R that what follows the # is to be ignored.\nWe use comments to write explanatory notes about the code. A comment should explain the purpose of a command or code and not just be a description of what it does.",
